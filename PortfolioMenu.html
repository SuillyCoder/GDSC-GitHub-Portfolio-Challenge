            <div class="textSect">
                <p>Hello. Hi there. You’re prolly thinking to yourself: 
                    “just who exactly is this guy?” Well for starters, 
                    my name is Enzo Basuil:  a 19 year old Cebuano.
                    I’ve got a good rep with my family, and we always like 
                    to think of each other as close friends. 
                    Had my elementary education in STAS Pardo Annex, 
                    high school education in DBTC - Cebu Inc., and 
                    college education in USC Talamban Campus.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="textSect mid">
                <p>I’ve gained skills in academic proficiency, public speaking, 
                    slight leadership and organization skills, as well as emotional 
                    control (workin’ on it). I’m also the type of guy who’s fine 
                    with sucking at first (don’t), but striving for the better later on. 
                    Got sum good friends by my side. Mainly the ones who’re all weird, 
                    wacky, and kooky. But hey, they’re my kind of people.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="textSect">
                <p>I’m into stuff like coding, videogames, creative writing,
                     art and illustration, & psychology / mindset improvement.
                    As per my goal in life….I’ll say it’s a bit fuzzy. What 
                    I do know, is that I want to get a good experience out of 
                    college education, get a stable job to build my standing, 
                    and see where I want to go from there. I have 1st and 2nd 
                    year to figure it out, so it’ll work. Probably.</p>

                            have created several art outlets (such as my main Facebook
                            page: SuilluStrative) in order to showcase my artworks and

                            has allowed me to gain a good amount of self-confidence and 
                            social skills to help me out. I mainly started doing oratorical
                            speech contests in South Western University (one where I lost
                            and one where I scored a place), which then moved on to me

                            moved on to me performing emcee gigs (over 5 times) in our school.

                            also have experience when it comes to creative writing and story composition. I
